    summary: |
      Akash Subramaniam is a philomath.



       He enrolled himself for a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and his fascination continued when he learned Data Structures and Algorithms – that is the technical aspects of machinery and technology. At HIFIT industries, the supplier for Bharat Benz, he was introduced to basic operations and learned there were a huge number of tiers for every giant automotive firm. He was astounded by the network and planning one would require building a car.

      Although this decision wasn’t his alone, the entire world knew that the dream country for a Computer Science and Technology aspirant is The United States of America. Since he entered Northeastern University, Boston for Master of Science in Computer Science, he wants to know every nook and cranny about Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning in the industry. Overall, from being a trainee in a supplier company to an intern in Mr Cooper, Akash has grown a specific set of skills and more importantly, has learned a number of things along the way.

      And now, we are right back where we started. The only difference is Harish is no longer a 4-year-old who imagines his legs are wheels. He is now a 25 year old, confident in the traits he has acquired through the years, and confident knowing the management of the whole chain of suppliers.

      He is still a philomath, still looking out to learn more. There are still several questions from his younger days that are left unanswered, but he is still in the pursuit to find those answers with his immaculate imagination and consistent hard work.
      Experienced Software Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the Fin-tech industry. Skilled in React Js, C#, Data Structures and Algorithms.
