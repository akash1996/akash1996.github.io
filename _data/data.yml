    summary: |
      “We spend more time shoveling coal than steering the ship. We want to shift our energy to looking at the data and navigating where we are going.”
      -- Robert Kagarise, Director of population health informatics and IT for the Delaware Valley Accountable Care Organization

      I cannot agree more with the above quote. The abundant availability of data has increased the importance of Machine Learning (ML) in research areas. For example, in health care, ML algorithms have been useful in predicting cancer characteristics from imaging or diagnosing fractures from x-rays. Personally, I am interested in the application of ML algorithms in early detection and diagnosis of mental health disorders. I believe that mental illness is one of the most overlooked problems in today’s world. Recent works have shown that the application of computer vision and natural language processing in analyzing patients’ speech data from therapy sessions is useful in the treatment of mental health issues. I would like to contribute more to this field by pursuing graduate studies in the field of computer science.

      Since my childhood, problem solving has been an exhilarating experience for me. I have participated and won several awards in competitive exams that test our aptitude and computational skills. My interest in problem solving allowed me to excel in academics at every step in my education. Throughout twelve years of schooling I have always been ranked among the top of my class. It was then that I realized the field of engineering in computer science would expose me to challenging obstacles in the fields of Data Structures, Algorithms, and other similar fields. I was intrigued by the idea of indulging myself in such complex problems, which motivated me to secure admission in one of the prestigious universities in India - Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

      The courses in my undergraduate studies such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Machine Learning and Databases allowed me to appreciate the importance of data in guiding research in all fields. In order to apply my theoretical knowledge and get a hands-on experience, I worked on a project for Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) in which I built a recommendation system for BHUVAN - a web based utility to access public geospatial data in the form of thematic maps detailing information regarding water resources, land cover, agricultural areas and regions with disaster susceptibility. The recommendation system provided service suggestions based on the surveyor’s interests in identifying relevant maps. For this, I implemented Markov’s clustering algorithm on the minimum spanning tree to find a community of nodes in the cluster that are similar. This project allowed me to appreciate and comprehend the strength of machine learning models in enhancing the human knowledge through statistical data that might not be evident from human intuition.




      After working on several short spanned projects, I sought for a professional experience. During my final year of college, I acquired an internship opportunity at the US Based company, Mr. Cooper. I was offered an internship out of 1000 suited candidates. Since the enterprise deals with sensitive data such as loans and mortgages, security and privacy are vital for any application used by the employees and customers. I built an authentication framework which was later used by all applications used within the enterprise.

      After my graduation in 2018, I was offered a job at Mr. Cooper because of my credible work during my internship. I saw it as an opportunity to work in an enterprise in which data analytics serves as a key factor in maintaining a profitable business model. I was responsible for building a data pipeline that drastically reduced the workload of auditors and underwriters by representing data in a simple and efficient manner. For this, I equipped myself with the skills to work on technologies such as Microsoft Azure Services, .NET and React Js and containerized the code using Docker and added CI/CD pipelines for deployment.

      Apart from my projects and work experience, my enthusiasm in working with data and analyzing it to get insights is also bolstered by my personal experience in the application of data analytics in real life. I was very fortunate to have served as the Head of ANOKHA - our university’s technical festival, in which students from nationwide colleges and universities take pride in participating in the technical competitions. During my tenure as the Head of planning committee, I analyzed the participant information database from the earlier editions of the competitions to optimize the resource allocation and increase the participation in the current edition. As a result, the 2018 edition of ANOKHA was a huge success and was highly appreciated by the professors, students and the participants.

      My application to the Northeastern University was inspired by the university’s large scale research in the field of Machine Learning. I believe that the wide range of courses offered by the Khoury College of Computer Sciences will provide me a comprehensive exposure to the concepts in this domain. Lecturer Clark Freifeld’s extensive research on Machine Learning is intriguing. I was fascinated by one of his papers titled “A case study of the New York City 2012-2013 influenza season with daily geocoded Twitter data from temporal and spatiotemporal perspectives. J Med Internet Res” and I would like to work under him on scalable algorithms to understand the spatiotemporal analysis. I would also like to research on the paper “Social Media Listening for Routine Post-Marketing Safety Surveillance” in order to understand how social media (‘social listening’) is being used to supplement established approaches for pharmacovigilance.

      My goal is to improve my skills in Machine Learning and learn novel approaches in analyzing data that enable important discoveries by experts in the mental health field. I believe that pursuing my graduate education at the Northeastern University would provide me with a strong background for my career. I understand the nature of roads ahead and commitment levels required. I hope a wonderful opportunity would be given to perceive my objectives of earning an admission to such an esteemed university. Thank you for considering my application.

      Akash Subramaniam is a philomath.




      Although this decision wasn’t his alone, the entire world knew that the dream country for a Computer Science and Technology aspirant is The United States of America. Since he entered Northeastern University, Boston for Master of Science in Computer Science, he wants to know every nook and cranny about Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning in the industry. Overall, from being a trainee in a supplier company to an intern in Mr Cooper, Akash has grown a specific set of skills and more importantly, has learned a number of things along the way.

      And now, we are right back where we started. The only difference is Harish is no longer a 4-year-old who imagines his legs are wheels. He is now a 25 year old, confident in the traits he has acquired through the years, and confident knowing the management of the whole chain of suppliers.

      He is still a philomath, still looking out to learn more. There are still several questions from his younger days that are left unanswered, but he is still in the pursuit to find those answers with his immaculate imagination and consistent hard work.
      Experienced Software Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the Fin-tech industry. Skilled in React Js, C#, Data Structures and Algorithms.
